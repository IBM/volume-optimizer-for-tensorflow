This work is described in the paper:
Francisco Barahona and Joao Goncalves,
Training Neural Networks with an algorithm for piecewise linear functions
2021

This code is an implementation of the algorithm described
in the paper above to be used in TensorFlow.

In order to use this optimizer, add the following to your
TensorFlow code:

import volume_optimizer

Also, you need to substitute the call to your current optimizer
(for example, the gradient descent optimizer) by a call
to the Volume optimizer. For example, if you have a line
such as
opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer()
replace it with
opt = volume_optimizer.VOLUME()
